In the pursuit of addressing the substantial challenges posed by plant diseases within agriculture, the authors of the **CCL'20** dataset have crafted an algorithm focused on detecting citrus diseases. These diseases have significant economic ramifications due to their capacity to cause reduced agricultural output and unstable food supplies. Citrus plants, in particular, are highly vulnerable to a range of factors, including climate fluctuations, pests, and diseases, which result in diminished crop yields and quality. The recent advancements in computer vision have found widespread applications in the realm of plant disease detection and classification. These developments offer promising prospects for early disease identification, ultimately leading to enhancements in agricultural practices. 

While ongoing research endeavors in the realm of citrus pest diseases are notable, there exists a substantial challenge in translating research outcomes into practical agricultural applications. This challenge is attributed to the scarcity of research datasets and the limited scope of pests included in these datasets. To address this gap, the authors embarked on a mission to construct a comprehensive dataset. This dataset encompasses a total of 20,000 images portraying citrus pests, both in the form of fruits and leaves, all sourced from real cultivation sites.

Citrus, being exceptionally sensitive to environmental factors, is frequently beset by pests and diseases. Among the most prevalent citrus pests, the citrus bacterial canker (CBC) assumes significance in subtropical climates, caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp (XCC). This disease manifests through symptoms such as early leaf and fruit shedding, desiccation of small branches, the appearance of brown spots, and the formation of small blister-like lesions on leaves, fruits, and stems, which initially start small and progressively expand. CBC, originally a concern in Australia, the USA, and South American countries, has recently surfaced in Asia, emerging as a global citrus disease of considerable consequence. In addition, citrus huanglongbing (HLB), caused by the Asian citrus psyllid and Candidatus liberibacter spp., poses an equally devastating threat to the citrus industry. The transmission of HLB occurs through an insect vector, and there is presently no cure for citrus trees affected by this ailment. Prevention and the removal of infected trees represent the only viable means to curtail the disease's spread.

Furthermore, it is noteworthy that while citrus pests affect the same fruit type, the specific diseases and pests vary based on the region and environmental conditions. Consequently, to develop models for citrus pest diagnosis and classification that are applicable across diverse agricultural environments, it is imperative to create an extensive dataset encompassing various citrus pests.

While extant studies [17–19] have primarily utilized images from open datasets such as Kaggle and the Citrus Disease Image Gallery Datasets, these datasets predominantly feature midstream citrus pests found predominantly in Australia and the USA, with a focus on citrus species adapted to subtropical climates. To address this gap, the authors explored citrus trees native to Asia that exhibited pests similar to CBC and HLB, while also being amenable to the collection of new pest images. Notably, pests such as CBC, red mites (causing Panonychus citri disease), and aphids (causing Toxoptera citricida disease) were identified as pertinent subjects for investigation but had not been thoroughly examined in prior research.

To construct the dataset, images of pest-free citrus fruits and images featuring pest-infestations (encompassing both fruits and leaves) were meticulously obtained from a citrus farm in Jeju, Korea, during the year 2021. As images sourced from actual plantations often introduce noise into the dataset, rigorous measures were adopted to mitigate potential noise issues. These measures included capturing images under various conditions to ensure the subject's visibility and adjusting parameters such as height, angle, distance, and lighting to maintain consistent image quality. Photographs were taken against a white background, eliminating issues related to subject shaking, shading, and light reflection. The resulting dataset comprised high-quality images, minimizing the occurrence of noise-related problems. Subsequently, over 25,000 images were collected, and to reduce data bias among pest classes, classes with fewer than 1000 images were excluded from the final dataset. The dataset consisted of a total of 20,000 images, which were subsequently randomly divided into training images, validation images, and test images in an 8:1:1 ratio. As detailed in Table 2, the number of images for validation and test sets was standardized for each class. The dataset encompassed 2545 images of pest-free citrus fruits, 1716 images of citrus fruits affected by CBC, 2455 images of normal citrus leaves, and 2545 images of citrus leaves afflicted by CBC. Furthermore, it included 9552 images of citrus leaves hosting Panonychus citri and 1918 images of citrus leaves infested with Toxoptera citricida. This comprehensive dataset consisted of 16,000 training images, 2000 validation images, and 2000 test images, all of which were RGB images in JPG format with a resolution of 1920 × 1090. The samples from the dataset are illustrated in Figure 3, with additional details provided in Table 2.
